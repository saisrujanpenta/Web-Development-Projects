Built a professional portfolio website and added contents relevant to that which includes education details,
projects, certifications and contact information.

1. The CSS script is written in a different file and then it is linked to html file using "<link>" tag.

2. Used "float" for the items in the left and right divs and "overflow" for the responsive design of education 
details table.

3. "Column layout structure" is used through out the website keeping all the details in the right column and 
contact information in left column.

4. Used "position:absolute/relative" properties in many cases.

5. Used both "tel" and "mailto" options in contact information. 

6. Added a table to showcase my education details and styled it using CSS selectors. Used "class names, table 
and tr,th,td" as CSS selectors.

7. A professional image gallery is used for certifications part with hover effects and figure captions. 
Used "<figure>" and "<figcaption>" for the image gallery. As for the hover effects, I gave the "shadow property" 
with a matching color.

8. Used html and html5 tags all over the code. Few of them are like, "<section>, <nav>, <img>, <ul>, <li>, <hr>, 
<table>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <footer>" and many more.

9. Made the website responsive using "@media" queries so that it looks good on all kinds of devices. 

10. Now for the creative part, 
    
In the intro page, I have added an animation behind the text which gives an illusion of sliding effect. 
For this, I have made the text as "outlined letters" using "color:transparent" and "webkit-text-stroke: 1px color" 
property and added a background image of diagnol stripes.

Now, gave the "background-position as 0"  and "animation as linear infinite" which makes the background image to 
move linearly till infinite. Added keyframes at 100%.

And also, I have added a "Go to top" button which will take the user to the top section from the bottom section 
without having to scroll increasing user experience.
