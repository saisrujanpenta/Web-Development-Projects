            <p><strong>Flat Bread Company</strong></p>
            <p>The history of Flatbread goes back at least 5000 years when men and women first began “baking” in enclosed earthen mounds. The simple leap from an open fire to a more controlled heating process expanded the culinary possibilities for all mankind. We rolled into the picture in 1998, going back, in order to move forward. Since then, the Flatbread Company has been introducing people to the magic of earth and fire, and how that combination can produce incredible tasting pizza. Beginning in Amesbury, Massachusetts in the summer of 1998, our mission of providing both guests and team members a place to “renew their spirit”, has never wavered. The story of Flatbread is a story of the people that work here and the guests that support it.</p>
