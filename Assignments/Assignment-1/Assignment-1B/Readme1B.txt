I have created a webpage showing the places to visit and food to explore in a city called Portland in Maine. 

	The home page consists of a header with a logo in it and section named "Things to do" div where two hyperlinks are given which will take us into 	another pages. 

	In "Places to Visit" page, I have used different images to show the places a tourist can visit and a description for each image. I have also used 	videos and a audio tags.

	In "Food to Explore" page, I have used images and description t suggest food places.
