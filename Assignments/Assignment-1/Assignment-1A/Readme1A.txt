I have created a basic webpage for a coffee shop for this question. It is a three page website, it includes a home, about and contact us pages. 

	
	The home page consists of the name, logo and tagline of the coffee shop along with a table that consists of different branches it is located in. 

	The About page consists of a small backstory of the coffee shop and the details of the founders. 

	The Contact us page consists of a form where customers can write 	anything they want to say about the cafe.


TAGS USED:

1. Favicon - Favicon is added to the webpage using <link> tag where the relationship is mentioned as "icon".

2. <header> - This element is used to represent a container for introductory content or set of navigational links. In <header> I have included logo and nav bar(About and ContactUs).

3. Hyperlink - With the hyperlinks, one can click and jump to another document or another web page. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse will turn into a little hand. The hyperlinks need not only be texts, they can be images or any html element as well. I have used this hyperlinks to navigate from home page to "About" and "Contact Us" pages.

4. Images - Images can improve the design and appearance of the web page. I have added a many images wherever required.
